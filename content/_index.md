I'm a Computer Science student who loves all things technology related. In my free
time I like to experiment with new technologies, read books, solve Rubik’s cubes
and 3D print/model useful things. I’m always open to learning new and exciting
things and do so regularly. My current interests are System Programming, Machine
Learning and Programming Language Creation.
