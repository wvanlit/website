## Going Virtual
Ah Java, my introduction to Object Oriented Programming with all its glorious boilerplate code. 
The one thing I enjoy most about almost every new language that comes out is that they have learned their lesson from Java and now require a lot less code (and knowledge) to just print "Hello World!" to the screen.

## Verbose Beauty
But it's not all bad. While it does require a lot of code to do certain things this is also its beauty. Java's syntax gives it something special, **clarity**. You'll never doubt if a method is public or private, what this function returns or what interface this class implements, because it's all in the code.
