## Getting Close to the Metal
C was the first language I learned, as it's thaught together with [Java](/language/java/) to every first year Computer Science student at the university I attend. The fun thing about C is that it does not hide a lot of difficult concepts behind abstractions (looking at you [Java](/language/java/)). I've always liked optimizing things and C allows me to optimize everything to my hearts content. Of course the absence of abstractions also makes it more prone to hard to find bugs, but who doesn't like a challenge now and then?

## My Introduction to C
In the first classes of uni we started programming with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc). Arduino uses a C / C++ subset combined with its own standard library to allow users to program prototyping boards.

Most of our projects are made using Arduino, especially in the first year. I've made all sorts of cool projects, such as an elevator, a line-follower robot and an ATM.
